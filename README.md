## ✨Project Description

This project shows how to develop classic *Snake Game* using C++
programming language.It shows the usage of important concepts in Object Oriented Programming Langauge. 

Players get to guide the snake on a 2D plane, eating fruits that appear randomly and trying not to crash into the walls of the game or the snake's body. Since the snake grows longer after eating, navigation gets trickier as points are added to the player's score and the snake crashes, or the player quits. 


## 🌟Key Features

1. Interactive Gameplay: The player controls the snake's movement using keyboard keys (W,,A, S, D,↑,←,↓,→).  
2. Dynamic Snake Growth: Eating fruits causes the snake to grow
3. Random Food Generation: Food (*) is placed at random positions that do not overlap the snake.  
4. Game Termination: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.  
5. Score Tracking: The player's score increases by 0,10,20 and 50 points with each fruit consumed. Stores high score until the program is terminated.  
6. Real-time Input Handling: Supports non-blocking keyboard input using conio.h.  
7. Windows Supported:It supports only Windows OS as we are using windows.h library.  
8. Multiple-fruit system Different types of fruit emerge at different score of the user.
9. Obstacles in a Snake game add a layer of strategic challenge by restricting movement, demanding precise control, and creating a dynamic environment that tests players' planning and reflexes.
10. Snake name is given to user for a personal

## 🛠Installation 

To run the Snake game, follow these steps:

1.  *Clone the Repository:*
    bash
    $ git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game-cpp.git](https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game-cpp.git)
    $ cd snake-game-cpp
    
2.  *Compile the Code (using g++):*
    bash
    $ g++ snake_game.cpp -o snake_game.exe  # For Windows
    $ g++ snake_game.cpp -o snake_game
    
3.  *Run the Game:*
    bash
    $ ./snake_game.exe  # For Windows   
    $ ./snake_game

## 📚Data Structures Analysis

## 🔹 Data Structures Used

### Vector(std::vector<pair<int, int>>) ⛓

*   Stores the snake’s body.
*   Displays Obstacle in Grid.
*   Allows efficient insertion.
*   Eliminates the need for resizing like vector.

### 2D Grid Representation (std::pair<int, int>) 🗺

*   Tracks the snake's head, body, and food position.



## Snake Game - Object-Oriented Structure

This document outlines the object-oriented structure of the Snake game.

## Object-Oriented Structure

| Class                     | Responsibility                                                                    |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| snake_game               | Handles game logic, rendering, movement, collision detection.                     |
| list(pair(int, int)) snake | Stores the snake's body using a linked list.                                     |
| pair(int, int) food    | Stores the food's position in the grid.                                          |

### 🏷Important Data Members:

*   🏅 score: (int) The player's current score.
*   🏆 high_score: (int) The highest score achieved.
*   📍 head_x: (int) The x-coordinate of the snake's head.
*   📍 head_y: (int) The y-coordinate of the snake's head.
*   🍎 fruit_x: (int) The x-coordinate of the fruit.
*   🍎 fruit_y: (int) The y-coordinate of the fruit.
